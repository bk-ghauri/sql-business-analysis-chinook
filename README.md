# Answering Business Questions Using SQL

This project uses SQL to answer a series of business questions based on the **Chinook database**, which models a digital media store. The goal is to extract useful business insights from the available data to support decision-making.

All queries were executed within a **Jupyter Notebook** using the `ipython-sql` extension and the `sqlite` version of the Chinook database.
